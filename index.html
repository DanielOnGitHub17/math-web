        I love math,
        and since it was what attracted me to Computer Science,
        most of the first programs I wrote solved problems like
        resolving quadratic equations, getting the standard deviation of some numeric data, etc.<br>
        The following resources use HTML5 to visualize math concepts. Enjoy using them.

            <span>PI</span>
            From King Solomon's pool in the Bible, to Archimedes, to the chinese, and to super computers of today,
            Pi has grown.
            This tool uses the Archimedes method, drawing two same-sided shapes and estimating the
            area of the circle between them by comparing their areas.
            I calculated areas by 'dividing' any created shape into (number of sides - 2) triangles.
            The algorithm was difficult for me, but I believe it was worth it.

            <span>Tables</span>
            Tables makes calculating a table of values for polynomials easy.
            By just inputing a polynomial, users can see values substituted on it
            across an interval.

            <span>Matrices</span>
            In my first year at high school, a friend of mine asked me,
            "what are matrices about?". I answered, "playing with numbers".
            That's what this webpage helps you do. So go ahead and
            transpose, determine, multiply, and play as much as possible.

            <span>Questions and Answers</span>
            Although this one is not fully implemented, it still offers some functionality.
            Its principle is as simple as its title.
            After specifying a mode, and the number of questions,
            you answer the questions, clicking next, show answer, and finally, submit.
